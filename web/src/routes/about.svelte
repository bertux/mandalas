    Mandalas are procedurelly generated bitmaps recorded as NFT on
    <a

      class="underline">ethereum</a>. There are millions of millions of them,
    (2^160)-1 to be exact.

    Their eight-fold symmetry also ensure that a single difference is actually
    repeated. As such they are also great for identity icon improving upon the

    number of ethereum addresses and so each address has a unique representation

    This website allows you to mint them on the
    <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank" class="underline">ethereum
      network</a>. Each time you mint you pay at a certain price and the price
    then increase. You can later burn the mandala to get back 95% of the current
    price. This is similar to

    Mandalas have also the particularity that their bitmap and metadata is fully
    generated on-chain. And contrary to many other on-chain projects, Mandalas
    make full use of the tokenURI standard. Hence no backend will ever be
    required to host the image.
